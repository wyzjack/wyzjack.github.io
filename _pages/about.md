I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (NEU). I am supervised by Prof. [Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) and I am a member of [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/). My research focuses on anomaly detection and optimization in machine learning.

News
======
* 12/2021: Our paper about gradient-free topology optimization is accepted by [**Nature Communications**](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/).  
* 09/2021: Start the journey at NEU, Boston, MA after one-year remote study (due to Covid-19 and travel ban).
