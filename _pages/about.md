I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (NEU). I am supervised by Prof. [Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) and I am a member of [SmileLab](https://fulab.sites.northeastern.edu/). My research mainly focuses on anomaly detection in machine learning and deep learning. I am also interested in Large Language Models recently.

My ultimate goal of AI related research is to reach the goal of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), a.k.a., strong AI.

Miscellaneous
======     
* I am a sports fan. I like basketball (I can [dunk 2.95m basketball hoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DisiCS1Rww)), soccer, badminton, table tennis and Go chess (I am Amateur 2 Dan). My favorite basketball players are Lebron James and Luka Doncic. My favorite soccer player is Lionel Messi. **If you want to play basketball with me, contact me via email or WeChat (see Contact section below)**. My lab colleagues and I usually play at the second floor of [Marino Recreation Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marino+Recreation+Center/@42.3401825,-71.092249,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e37a18c400467f:0xdb4ad70af6e7d61!8m2!3d42.3401919!4d-71.0900511).          
* I am a music fan. I love listening to Hiphop. My favorite rappers are 8aceMak1r (a.k.a. PG One) and Post Malone (if he is). I also like singing songs when I have time. [Here](https://static-play.kg.qq.com/node/personal?uid=639c9984272d348e&shareUid=639c9984272d348e&chain_share_id=tWOUPJ-mqo1xs8pd31NPft6aiOPRvemjZB2yD6MVJNs&pageId=homepage_me) is my “We Sing” (全民K歌) account where I record my singings. I am actually pretty good at singing as I can easily get SSS scores on "We Sing".
