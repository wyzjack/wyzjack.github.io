I am now a Research Assistant to Prof. [Jian Sun](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jiansun) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm). I received  B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Honors Program) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2020. I will join [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) as a Computer Engineering Ph.D. Student this fall.

I was a visiting student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2019 Spring, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/).

My research focuses on designing efficient and sound machine learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees. I am particularly interested in deep learning and its applications in computer vision area.
