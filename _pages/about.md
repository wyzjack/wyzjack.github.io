I am now a Research Assistant to Prof. [Jian Sun](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jiansun) at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I received my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Honors Program) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2020. I will join [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) as a Computer Engineering Ph.D. Student this fall.

My research focuses on designing machine learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees. I am particularly interested in deep learning and its applications in computer vision area.
