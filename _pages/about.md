I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (NEU). I am supervised by Prof. [Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) and I am a member of [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/). My research mainly focuses on anomaly detection in machine learning and deep learning.  

**I am actively looking for 2023 summer research internship opportunities on machine learning and deep learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.**

Miscellaneous
======
* I was born in Nantong, Jiangsu, China, in 1999. I love my hometown, which is a beautiful and livable city.   
* I am a sports fan. I like basketball (I can [dunk 2.95m basketball hoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DisiCS1Rww)), soccer, badminton, table tennis and Go chess (I am Amateur 2 Dan). My favorite basketball players are Lebron James and Luka Doncic. My favorite soccer player is Lionel Messi (God bless Argentina in FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022!). **If you want to play basketball with me, contact me via email or WeChat (see Contact section below)**. My lab colleagues and I usually play at the second floor of [Marino Recreation Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marino+Recreation+Center/@42.3401825,-71.092249,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e37a18c400467f:0xdb4ad70af6e7d61!8m2!3d42.3401919!4d-71.0900511).
