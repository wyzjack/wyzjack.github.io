I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (NEU). I am supervised by Prof. [Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) and I am a member of [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/). My research mainly focuses on anomaly detection in machine learning and deep learning. 

My ultimate goal of AI related research is to reach the goal of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), a.k.a., strong AI. I actually do not believe current purely deep learning driven AI research (basicly fitting data and to generalize well on certain tasks) can lead to strong AI. I believe that assistance from Biological and Neuroscience field is needed. Nevertheless, I am on my way to realize it. what
