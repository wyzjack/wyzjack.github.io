Hi, I am a graduate student in Computer Engineering at [Northeastern Unversity](https://www.northeastern.edu/) (NEU). I am advised by Prof. [Yun Raymond Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) and I am a member of [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/). 

I received  B.S. in Mathematics from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm) (XJTU) in 2020, where I was supervised by Prof. [Jian Sun](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jiansun). I was a visiting student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2019 Spring, where I worked with Prof. [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/).
